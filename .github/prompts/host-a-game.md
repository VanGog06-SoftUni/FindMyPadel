Lets move on to the next app functionality - host a game. Here are the requirements:

- host a game should be a protected page - only visible after signing in. There is already a link in the nav menu for that
- use the background.jpg image as background, same as hero section, sign in and sign up pages
- the page should have a calendar like component (similar to google calendar) with different time slots, indicating every 30 mins, e.g. 07:30, 08:00, 08:30, so on
- the first time on the calendar should be 07:00 and last one should be 23:30.
- show each slot in green for now, use the primary color, this will indicate the it is free (not booked)
- show each slot as clickable item, with a cursor of pointer when hovering. Nothing should happen when user clicks on any slot - will implement that in the future
- include a date picker - add date selection and update slots by date
