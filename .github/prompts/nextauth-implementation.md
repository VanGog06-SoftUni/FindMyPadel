Next thing I want to add to my padel booking app is the authentication functionality. I will be using nextauth for that. I want you to set it up, along with the needed database tables. For the database, I plan to use PostgreSQL + Prisma. Setup all tools needed. I want my table to have the following information: first name, last name, hashed password (it should include salt), email address
