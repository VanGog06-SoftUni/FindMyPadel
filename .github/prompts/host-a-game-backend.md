Now that I have the complete host a game functionality, I want to create the back end part of it. Whenever user clicks on "Reserve", inside the dialog, the data should be saved in the database. I want name, date, start time, end time, payment to be saved. This should create a new entry in the database. Other players will be able to join the hosted games. A total of 4 players (host + 3 other) will be able to join a game. UI for that is still not ready, it will be ready in future and must not be part of this plan.
