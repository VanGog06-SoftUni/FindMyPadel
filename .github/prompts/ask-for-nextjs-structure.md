I have this idea to build a booking app about padel. Users will be able to host a game and other will be able to join those games. I want to have a nice looking, easy to use ui. I have the tech stack I want to use inside tect_stack.md file. I want from you to give me a prompt that I will be sending to the llm. The idea of that prompt will be just to scaffold the project. I don't want to build or setup anything extra
